Personal Website
This repository contains the code for my personal website.

The website has been built using a powerful combination of technologies including React, Chakra UI, and Framer Motion. These tools have been selected for their ease of use, and the robust, responsive, and seamless user experience they help create.

React
React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where you need a fast and interactive user experience. It allows for building reusable UI components.

Chakra UI
Chakra UI is a simple, modular, and accessible component library that provides building blocks to compose React applications in a more intuitive and simpler way. Chakra UI provides a set of accessible, reusable, and composable React components that make it super easy to create websites and apps.

Framer Motion
Framer Motion is a production-ready motion library for React that aims to provide a simple and intuitive API for animating components. It provides animation features that are both powerful and easy to use, making it an excellent choice for implementing complex animations for web projects.
